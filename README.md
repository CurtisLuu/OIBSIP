Oasis InfoByte Internship Projects

This has been a great learning experience! My notebooks in weeks 1-2 weren't the best, and I didn't apply the best practices for ML. However, I believe I improved every week, and in week 3 I created a notebook that isn't too shabby! I hope to learn a lot more in the future :).
